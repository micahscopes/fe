//! Derive-provider capability/witness GOAL diagnostics (FCO Level 1, "W-D").
//!
//! A derive provider's `derive` fn names a *goal* in type-argument position:
//! `Evidence<Eq<T>>` (the witness parameter/return) and `ImplBuilder<Eq<T>>` (a
//! `uses (..)` capability). The `Eq<T>` there is a CONSTRAINT, not an ordinary
//! `*`-kinded type.
//!
//! As of FCO R2/R3 the GOOD case needs no special handling: `Evidence` /
//! `ImplBuilder` are `Constraint`-kinded constructors (`Constraint -> *`, K04b),
//! a saturated concrete goal `Eq<T>` lowers to a `Constraint`-kinded
//! [`TyData::ConstraintTerm`] (R2), and the provider signature is no longer
//! exempt from the ordinary type walk (R3) — so a valid goal type-checks like any
//! other application and the concrete goal is carried by the `ConstraintTerm` in
//! the lowered signature. This module no longer REPRESENTS the goal (the old
//! `CapabilityGoal::ConcreteTrait(TraitInstId)` carrier value was never read);
//! it only retains the goal-DIAGNOSTIC pass for ILL-FORMED goals, which the
//! ordinary walk does not report well:
//!
//!   - a live `* -> Constraint` parameter head (`Evidence<P<T>>`) is kind-correct
//!     and lowers SILENTLY — only this pass catches it (`6-0008`);
//!   - a bare/unsaturated head (`Evidence<Eq>`) degrades to a generic `2-0006`
//!     instead of the provider-specific guidance (`6-0009`);
//!   - a goal in the `uses (..)` clause is not walked by the ordinary signature
//!     diag at all.
//!
//! The pass classifies each recognized goal position by re-lowering the inner
//! HIR goal exactly as the where-clause path does
//! (`WherePredicateView::constraint_application_diags`), so a provider goal is
//! held to the same boundary as `where Eq<T>`. A concrete saturated goal lowers
//! cleanly and yields no diagnostic; every other shape is classified to a typed
//! [`GoalError`] and reported.
//!
//! Goal positions are recognized by RESOLVED IDENTITY (`core::derive::Evidence` /
//! `::ImplBuilder`), not by the bare names: a user type merely *named* `Evidence`,
//! without `use core::derive::Evidence`, is not a goal position.
//!
//! Placement: this is an analysis-layer helper (post scope-graph merge), NOT the
//! expansion-stage `validate_impl_provider` — [`lower_hir_constraint_application`]
//! reaches the merged scope graph, which the expansion stage must not read
//! (it would salsa-cycle). See `docs/dev/FCO_PROBE_provider_goal_representation.md`.
