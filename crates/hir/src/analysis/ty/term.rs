//! Normalized const-predicate terms — the M5 term language.
//!
//! This module gives where-clause const predicates (`T::SIZE >= 50`,
//! `1 + 1 == 3`, `check<T>()`) a *semantic identity*: a salsa-interned,
//! normalized term ([`TermId`]). Stage 2 `Eq` goals, evidence keys, and the
//! predicate prover compare predicates by this identity instead of by raw HIR
//! syntax, so two occurrences of the same predicate intern to the same term
//! and law proofs stop failing with "expected X, found X".
//!
//! The module is deliberately standalone: it consumes existing HIR and
//! name-resolution queries but nothing in the compiler depends on it yet.
//! Its three contracts are:
//!
//! 1. **Lowering** ([`lower_hir_to_term`]) is *partial*: only the predicate
//!    expression fragment is accepted, and every rejected construct gets a
//!    precise, per-variant error ([`TermLowerError`]) — never a catch-all.
//! 2. **Normalization** ([`normalize_term`]) is bottom-up, value-preserving
//!    constant folding plus determinism-only operand ordering. It is *not* a
//!    semantic canonicalizer: distinct comparison relations are never merged
//!    (`x >= 50` and `50 <= x` stay different terms, by design — see
//!    [`normalize_term`]).
//! 3. **Versioning** ([`TERM_LANG_VERSION`]) tracks the shape of the term
//!    language so persisted/derived artifacts keyed on terms can detect
//!    staleness. The in-module ledger test fails whenever the shape changes
//!    without a version bump.
//!
//! Provenance: the accepted expression fragment mirrors what effort2's
//! const-predicate matcher actually walked
//! (`ty_check/const_predicate_prover.rs:165-256`: literals, binary/unary
//! ops, paths, calls) plus what the M5 port map's gate semantics require
//! (CTFE-opaque const-fn applications such as `check<T>()`). The
//! application shape mirrors this branch's `ConstExpr::UserConstFnCall`
//! (`analysis/ty/const_expr.rs`).
