//! References from generated code to authored declarations.
//!
//! Generated code is lowered into the module that receives it, but it names
//! declarations written elsewhere: the record a provider reflected, the trait
//! of a scoped goal, and the producer scope its quotation was written in.
//! Lowering a module never reads another module's lowered HIR, because that
//! module may itself receive code naming this one. An [`AuthoredScope`] names a
//! declaration by its module and the authored syntax it was written as, and
//! ordinary resolution binds it in that module's lowered scope graph when a
//! path or type containing it is resolved.
