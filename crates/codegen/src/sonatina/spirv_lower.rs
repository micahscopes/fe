//! Fe -> SPIR-V wire (slice S1): the shortest path from a Fe source to
//! naga-validated SPIR-V words.
//!
//! There is no SPIR-V lowering port. `compile_runtime_package_wasm` already
//! builds a Sonatina `Module` under the Wasm32 ISA whose `inst_set()` is
//! `NativeInstSet` (`wasm_lower.rs`), and Sonatina's `SpirvBackend` consumes any
//! `Module` by downcasting generically against `function.inst_set()`
//! (`isa/spirv/mod.rs`). So the wasm-path Module is SPIR-V-consumable
//! *unchanged*: this driver just hands it over. For an Add/Mul/Return
//! single-function kernel every op is inside SPIR-V's envelope.
//!
//! The naga validator runs *inside* `SpirvBackend::compile_module`, so a
//! returned `SpirvArtifact` is already a structurally-valid compute module (the
//! honest rung this slice earns is R-val: validated, NOT executed). Execution on
//! a real GPU runtime (lavapipe) is a later slice.
