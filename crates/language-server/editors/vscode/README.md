# Fe LSP client VSCode extension

## Development/Debugging
Build the language server by following [the `language-server` crate's README.md](../../README.md).

Then, open the Fe codebase root workspace in VSCode and press `F5` to debug the extension using the "Launch Fe VSCode Extension" configuration.

The VSCode extension will be compiled and a new VSCode window will open with the Fe test fixtures directory and this extension loaded.

## Building releases
